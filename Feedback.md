# Feedback


> “Feedback” is really three different things, with different purposes:
>
> Appreciation — motivates and encourages.
>
> Coaching — helps increase knowledge, skill, capability, growth, or raises feelings in the relationship.
>
> Evaluation — tells you where you stand, aligns expectations, and informs decision making.
