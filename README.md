# [WIP] Soft Skills: negotiation, selling ideas, convincing others, etc

## How it started

During routine 1:1 meeting with my HR manager we agreed that it would be really beneficial for my further career to work harder on soft (professional / human) skills. That's why we formed an initial (seed sentence):

> "Investigate possible learning sources about negotiation, selling and convincing others about your own solutions"

Main focus was to collect online articles on topic.
After initial research and some googling I had quite a big list of articles to process and some keywords I'm interested in.

Initial work was done in Evernote app with periodic email check-in with my manager. Later on I decided that it would be easier to manage work using Github repository of Markdown files.

Persuasion
noun, įtikinėjimas, įtikinimas, įkalbinėjimas
‘to persuade’ is: "to cause (someone) to do something by asking, arguing, or giving reasons". [5]

If you want to win an argument, ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work. [24]

People will do things that aren’t in their best interest, just to prove to you that they have autonomy. If you make it clear to them that it’s okay to say “no”, then you help them feel autonomous which makes them more collaborative. You call somebody up on the phone and say, “Have you got a few minutes to talk?” That will make anybody tighten up. Immediately they want to say “no” to that, because they know if they say “yes”, they’re going to get hooked in and be kept on the phone. The opposite is to say, “Is now a bad time to talk?” [16]
